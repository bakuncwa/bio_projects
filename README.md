1. Meselson-Stahl Calculator
- Applied the concept of density centrifugation and hydration that occurs within isotopic molecules to produce a mathematically feasible program of Meselson-Stahl's experiment of semi-conservative DNA replication within N-15-N-14 and N14-14 E. Coli isotopes
- The code calculates the percentage composition of nitrogen-14-nitrogen-15 isotopes by processing the user float input of any offspring generation
